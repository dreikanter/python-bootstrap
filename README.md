# Python Command-line Tool Bootstrap

This is an initiative to generalize typical python [CLI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) tool skeleton into a reusable bootstrap project. It includes a python package skeleton, setup script, typical developer environment settings including `.gitignore` and `.editorconfig` files, and some other stuff that could be used to save your time.
